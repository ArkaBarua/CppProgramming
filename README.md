# C++ Programming from scratch

After learning some of C. I thought to give a try to learn C++. When teacher asked me if I know how to code in C++. And the next I decided that I should learn C++.

## Warning

In this repo I am pushing those code that I wrote to learn C++. So there might be mistakes, code error. So this is not yet to be considered as an reference guide to learn C++.

## Resources

This repo is still active. So I may continue learning new things from new people & books. So resources of this repo could be many.
I first started this journey by watch a Free-code-camp video.
